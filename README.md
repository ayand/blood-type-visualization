# Blood Type Dashboard

This visualization is intended to show some simple stats about the distributions of blood types in the human population. The pie chart shows the percentage of the human population that contains each blood type. The matrix on the right indicates which blood types can donate blood to which other groups. Clicking on any one blood type's slice shows the possible donor-recipient combinations that that blood type is a part of.

One can also switch to another view which shows the distribution of blood types amongst Caucasians, African-Americans, Latino Americans, and Asians.

Information about the blood type distribution and donation combinations was acquired from:

Note: The percentages for the different ethnicities in the second link don't necessarily add up to 100% due to discrepancy.
